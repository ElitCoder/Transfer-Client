Building essentials:
* A valid C++ compiler for the chosen OS, e.g Visual Studio for Windows and g++ for Linux

Building:
mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. && cmake --build . && cd ..

Building with mingw32:
mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain-windows-mingw32.cmake && cmake --build . && cd ..

Development usage (Linux):
./create run <params> -- builds if not up to date and runs the executable
./create clean        -- builds the project from scratch
